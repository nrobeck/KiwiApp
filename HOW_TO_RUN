How to build and run Kiwi on your own Android device
####################################################

These directions assume that you already have downloaded and installed the
Android Developer Tools (ADT) Eclipse bundle. If not, you can download it at
developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

We also assume that your Android device (be it a tablet or a phone) is running
at least Android 4.0.3. (If your device is less than around two years old, it
almost certainly will be.) If it is running an older version of Android, ADT
will not allow you to install Kiwi on your device.


Code import, build, run instructions
------------------------------------

1.  Open Android Developer Tools

2.  You may need to install the Android API 17 SDK. Go to Window -> Android SDK
    Manager to launch the SDK manager.
    a. If there are any "packages" listed that say there are available updates,
        mark the checkbox next to them.
    b. Expand the list under Android 4.2.2 (API 17) and mark the checkboxes
        next to SDK Platform and Google APIs.

    NOTE: The ADT bundle should come with API 19 pre-installed. If you do not
    see API 19 as installed in the SDK manager, you should choose to install
    this too. (It shouldn't cause any problems not to have it, but it won't
    hurt to have it installed.)

    c. Click the "Install [X] packages..." button to install.
    d. Close the SDK manager, and restart ADT (File -> Restart)

3.  File -> Import... -> Android -> Existing Android Code Into Workspace.
    a. Click "Browse..." and check the directory where you extracted this zip
        file (i.e. the directory that contains this file)
    b. Mark the checkboxes next to "datetimepicker" and "Kiwi".
    c. Click Finish

4.  In the "Package Explorer" view in ADT, you should now see "datetimepicker"
    and "Kiwi". If you wait a few moment, any in-progress work Eclipse might be
    doing (look to the bottom right hand corner of the window) should complete,
    and both the datetimepicker and Kiwi projects should show no warnings or
    errors (errors being little red X's on the folder, warnings being yellow
    exclamation marks). If there are any errors, open the "Problems" view
    (Window -> Show View -> Problems) and see what the error is. (The code for
    Kiwi should work just fine, so if there are errors, something is amiss with
    your ADT installation or API installs.)

5.  In the Package Explorer view, right click on "Kiwi", and choose Run As ->
    Android Application. If you have an Android device connected to the
    computer (and ADB works with it), you should see a menu prompting you to
    select the device to run the application on. Choose your Android device and
    click the button to run the app.
